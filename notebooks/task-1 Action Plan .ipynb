    "## 1. Defining a Proxy Variable for Credit Risk\n",
    "Credit Risk Definition: Credit risk refers to the probability that a borrower may default on a loan. In this project, we will classify users into two groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Risk (Bad): Likely to default on the loan.\n",
    "Low Risk (Good): Less likely to default on the loan.\n",
    "Proxy Variable: A proxy variable is a variable that can substitute for a concept that is not directly observable. Since actual default data might not be present, we can use fraudulent transactions as a proxy for credit risk, assuming that users flagged for fraud are likely to be riskier customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "FraudResult: This binary variable (1 = Fraud, 0 = No Fraud) will serve as our initial proxy variable to categorize users into high or low risk. A value of 1 could indicate high-risk behavior (bad credit), while a value of 0 could indicate low-risk behavior (good credit)."

    "Step-by-Step Feature Mapping:\n",
    "We will analyze and select the features that are likely to have a high correlation with credit risk (i.e., FraudResult). The following features are potentially useful for predicting risk:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amount and Value of Transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Larger transaction amounts or higher frequency of transactions could indicate riskier behavior.\n",
    "Action: Analyze the distribution of Amount and Value to see if there’s a correlation with FraudResult.\n",
    "Customer and Account Information (CustomerId, AccountId, SubscriptionId):\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Repeat customers with stable account histories may have a lower credit risk.\n",
    "Action: Explore whether repeat customers with specific SubscriptionId or AccountId exhibit less risky behavior compared to new customers.\n",
    "Product and Provider Information (ProductCategory, ProviderId, ProductId):\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Certain product categories or providers may be associated with higher fraud rates, indicating higher credit risk.\n",
    "Action: Investigate whether specific ProductCategory or ProviderId is associated with higher fraud rates (i.e., proxy for high credit risk).\n",
    "Channel Used (ChannelId):\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Some channels (e.g., mobile vs. web) may be more prone to fraud, which could be indicative of riskier customer behavior.\n",
    "Action: Examine the correlation between ChannelId and fraud status.\n",
    "Country and Currency Codes (CountryCode, CurrencyCode):\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Certain countries or currencies may exhibit higher default rates based on economic conditions.\n",
    "Action: Analyze how geographic and currency information is correlated with fraud rates.\n",
    "Transaction Time (TransactionStartTime):\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Fraudulent transactions may happen more frequently at specific times (e.g., late at night), indicating risky behavior.\n",
    "Action: Perform a time-based analysis of transactions to identify any time-based patterns related to fraud.\n",
    "Pricing Strategy (PricingStrategy):\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Different pricing strategies may attract different customer types, influencing the risk of fraud.\n",
    "Action: Analyze the impact of PricingStrategy on fraud status.\n",
    "Other Features (BatchId, ProviderId, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis: Batch processing of transactions and specific providers may indicate patterns of risky behavior.\n",
    "Action: Explore correlations between these features and fraud.\n"
